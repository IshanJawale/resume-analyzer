# Cloudinary Migration Guide

This project has been updated to use Cloudinary for storing resume files instead of local media storage.

## What Changed

1. **Storage Backend**: Files are now stored in Cloudinary instead of local `media/` folder
2. **Folder Structure**: Files are stored in `media/resumes/{user_id}/` on Cloudinary
3. **Docker Configuration**: Removed media volume mount since files are now in the cloud

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Make sure your `.env` file has the correct Cloudinary credentials:
   ```
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

3. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Migrate Existing Files** (if you have existing local files):
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate_to_cloudinary
   ```

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: No storage limits on your server
- **CDN**: Faster file delivery worldwide
- **Backup**: Files are automatically backed up
- **Docker-friendly**: No need to manage media volumes
- **Production-ready**: Works seamlessly in containerized environments

## File Organization

Files are organized on Cloudinary as:
```
media/
└── resumes/
    ├── 1/
    │   ├── resume1.pdf
    │   └── resume2.pdf
    ├── 2/
    │   └── resume3.pdf
    └── ...
```

## Notes

- New uploads will automatically go to Cloudinary
- The `media/` folder in your project is no longer used for resume storage
- URLs are automatically generated by Cloudinary
- Files can be accessed directly via Cloudinary URLs
